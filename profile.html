<h1> History of anime </h1>
<p style="color:white">The first animated film released in Japan, and therefore the first anime, was probably released in late 1916 or very early ‘17 by Shimokawa Oten, made with chalk, and less than five minutes long. <br> The uncertainty comes from the fact that most early Japanese films were dismantled after the reels were finished. What survived that practice was largely lost with the destruction of many film studios and theaters in the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923, destroyed in the bombings of World War 2, or simply disintegrated over time. The nitrocellulose early films were printed on was extremely flimsy and incredibly flammable – not exactly a good recipe for preservation.</p>

<h1>The first full-length anime film </h1>
<p style="color:white">The first full-length anime film was Momotaro: Umi no Shinpei (Momotaro, Sacred Sailors), released in 1945. A propaganda film commissioned by the Japanese navy featuring anthropomorphic animals, its underlying message of hope for peace would move a young manga artist named Osamu Tezuka to tears</p>
